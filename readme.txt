This project will be a few connected pages showing some of the work I have done with my family history.

The homepage (which will be my landing page/index) should show the website title over a self created banner.
Below that is my image next to a paragraph breifly explaining the project displayed on the site.
The nav bar on top and the footer on the bottom will be displayed across the site.
