				<h3>
				About Me
				</h3>
				<p>
				My name is Kaylee Crance and I have been working on my family history since 2017. With some much work to do, I started with what was already done. 
				I entered research and information already gathered by my ancestors before starting to add to it. Since then, I've used my graphic design skills 
				to add graphical elements such as family trees, timelines, and a reworked family crest to the library of research. I don't plan to stop any time 
				soon as there is so much work to be done. If you see any errors in my work or would like to contribute, please contact me.
